{"name":"Weatherdata","tagline":"A simple R package that fetches Weather data from websites","body":"`weatherData` is a collection of functions that will fetch weather (Temperature, Pressure, Humidity etc.) data from the Web for you as clean data frame.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform weather Analysis, but don't wish to be bothered with\r\nscraping the data yourself, you can consider using `weatherData`.\r\n\r\n### Shiny App that uses WeatherData\r\n\r\n`WeatherCompare` is [a Shiny App](http://spark.rstudio.com/ram/WeatherCompare/) that uses the data brought over by weatherData and then summarized in various ways\r\n\r\n##Two Installation Options\r\n\r\nYou can install the version from CRAN, or you can try out the version hosted in Github. Github has the development version, where I am trying out the newer functions.\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Install from CRAN\r\n\r\nInstall and Load the library\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages('weatherData')\r\nlibrary(weatherData)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Install from Github\r\n\r\nThe latest version of weatherData is on Github. (Note that this is the development version, and is usually ahead of what's on CRAN.) To install the development version of weatherData from github, use the **`devtools`** package.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(\"devtools\")\r\ninstall_github(\"weatherData\", \"Ram-N\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the package has installed, load the library\r\n```\r\nlibrary(weatherData)\r\n```\r\nNote: Windows users must also first install\r\n[Rtools](http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to Use this package\r\n\r\n## Examples \r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(weatherData)\r\ncheckDataAvailabilityForDateRange(\"SFO\", \"2010-10-29\", \"2013-01-12\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe command above will see if weather data is available for the Airport supplied (\"SFO\") for the two end dates supplied: for the 20th Oct 2010 and for Jan 12th 2013 in this case.\r\n\r\nThis command is useful for a quick check, before invoking `getDateRangeWeather`\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndata(London2013)\r\n```\r\nThis is a data frame of Ambient temperature data, extracted\r\nfrom Weather Undergound. Each row has two entries\r\n(columns). The Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) and the\r\nTemperatureF (in degrees F) \r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\ngetCurrentTemperature(\"PIT\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function will get the latest recorded Temperature for a give city or station. Any valid US Airport code or International 4-letter Airport Weather Code is valid. For example \"EGLL\" for London, UK. \r\nNote: This function uses the Sys.Date to learn today's date\r\n\r\n```r\r\ngetStationCode(\"Buffalo\")\r\ngetStationCode(\"Buffalo\", state=\"WY\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function will return a record containing matches to a given\r\nstation name, and the 4 letter code can then be used in the arguments\r\nto other functions such as `getWeatherForDate()`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Suggestions\r\n\r\nSuggestions are welcome! If you would have a particular need for weather data,\r\nlet me know what changes you'd like to see in the package. If you find bugs, please do report it. Fetching data from the web can be fragile. Please consider submitting an Issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
